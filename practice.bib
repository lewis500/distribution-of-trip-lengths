abstract = {Four road pricing systems, with charges based on cordons crossed, distance travelled, time spent travelling and time spent in congestion, have been tested using the congested assignment network model SATURN and its elastic assignment demand response routine, SATEASY. All tests have been based on a SATURN application of the city of Cambridge, with charges imposed inside an appropriate ring of bypasses. While initial results showed that congestion pricing achieved the greatest increase in average speed in the charged area, later analysis cast doubt on its superiority. Congestion pricing is able to distinguish more effectively the extent to which different types of journey contribute to congestion and achieves given reductions in travel at lower levels of charge. However, it is much less effective in reducing distance travelled and, by encouraging use of minor roads, may achieve far smaller environmental benefits. Time-based pricing performs better than the other systems on most indicators. Generally, the results suggest that when rerouting effects are included in the predictive modelling process the benefits of road pricing may be significantly smaller than previously expected.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the horizontal and vertical equity effects of the Stockholm Trial with Congestion Pricing for morning commuters, in terms of both travel behavioral adjustments and welfare effects, as a result of the toll's direct effects and the behavioral adjustments. We consider specifically two behavioral adjustments: mode choice and departure time choice. Initial car drivers crossing the toll cordon had a 15 percentage-points higher rate of switching to public transit as compared with those not crossing the cordon. We also find some evidence of peak spreading, in particular toward a later departure time, as a result of the charging scheme, but most people choose a departure time within 15 min both before and during the trial. In the welfare analysis, we found no clear pattern of increasing burden by either increasing income or decreasing income, and the increase in the Gini Coefficient was insignificant. We also found no significant difference in either the mode-switching behavior or the average welfare effect for women versus for men. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The major transport study which has been undertaken as part of the project is outlined, and some of the results of the assessment of the effects of road pricing in Hong Kong are discussed. The paper describes the work on providing a demonstration accounting system and on defining the accounting and administrative requirements of a full system. The potential secondary benefits and uses of a road-pricing system, and of the technology, are also discussed. The paper concludes that the pilot-stage project in Hong Kong has been successful, and that electronic road pricing has been demonstrated as technically viable, administratively feasible and of significant potential benefit in helping to deal with Hong Kong's heavily congested urban road network.},

@article{Attard2015a,
abstract = {Road user charging is often thought of as a first best travel demand management solution for dealing with the issue of congestion, when compared to the use of parking charges. The case for this is that parking charges are more likely to result in improvements in the situation rather than an optimal outcome. One of the reasons is that parking can be seen as a complement to vehicle travel impacting on the termination point of a journey as opposed to charging directly for the use of road space as in the case of road user charging. In saying this parking charges are used extensively as a demand management measure and there are still only a few road user charging schemes worldwide. One scheme that has moved from a parking charge to a road user charge is the Controlled Vehicular Access system in Valletta, Malta where a fixed annual charge (V-licence) for access and parking into the city was replaced by a time-based road user charge implemented in May 2007. The aim of this paper is to assess the effects of road user charging in the context of ineffective parking policies, using the case of Valletta. The paper is based on scheme documentation, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, supplemented by personal observations of one of the authors directly involved in the process of developing and implementing the road user charging system. The research concludes that the overall impacts of the road user charge in the City were positive but more effort will have to be made to strengthen the road charging scheme and parking policy to effectively manage the travel demands of the islands' population.},

abstract = {SUMMARYRoad pricing LESSONS FROM LONDONThis paper assesses the original London Congestion Charging Scheme (LCCS) and its impacts, and it simulates the proposed extension which will include most of Kensington and Chelsea. It also touches upon the political economy of the congestion charge and the increase of the charge from {\pounds}5 to {\pounds}8 per day. The possibility of transferring the experience to Paris, Rome and New York is also discussed.The LCCS has had positive impacts. This was despite the considerable political influences on the charge level and location. It is difficult to assess the impacts of the increase of the charge from {\pounds}5 to {\pounds}8, which took place in July 2005, because no data have yet been released by Transport for London. The proposed extension of the charging zone does not seem to be an efficient change on economic grounds, at least for the specific boundaries, method of charging and level of charging that is currently planned. Our benefit cost ratios computed under different assumptions of costs and benefits are all below unity. Overall, the experience shows that simple methods of congestion charging, though in no way resembling first-best Pigouvian taxes, can do a remarkably good job of creating benefits from the reduction of congestion. Nevertheless, the magnitude of these benefits can be highly sensitive to the details of the scheme, which therefore need to be developed with great care.— Georgina Santos and Gordon Fraser},

abstract = {The city of Milan, one of the most car-dependent and polluted in Europe, is also among the few to have introduced a road pricing measure. The story of how this happened is of great interest, for it shows how EU regulations, scientific evidence and political action at the local level have concurred to bring about change in the city's transport policy. Unlike the well-known cases of London and Stockholm, it is concerns for the levels of pollution (rather than congestion) that have led to the introduction of the “Ecopass” scheme in 2008. Accordingly, in the following years the public debate has focused on the effectiveness of this pollution charge in reducing PM10 – a pollutant with adverse health impacts. Based on the analysis of media coverage and official reports, this paper argues that EU regulations had a crucial role in determining the newsworthiness of PM10 in Milan. Media},

Congestion tolls can be implemented at scales ranging from individual lanes on single links to national road networks. Tolls can be differentiated by time of day, road type and vehicle characteristics, and even set in real time according to current traffic conditions. Conventional toll booths have largely given way to electronic toll collection technologies. The main technology categories are roadside-only systems employing digital photography, tag {\&} beacon systems that use short-range microwave technology, and in-vehicle-only systems based on either satellite or cellular network communications. The best technology choice depends on the application. The rate at which congestion pricing is implemented, and its ultimate scope, will depend on what technology is used and on what other functions and services it can perform.},

abstract = {Several authors have argued that acceptability for road pricing is likely to increase with familiarity. The experiences in Stockholm, where a trial period with congestion charges changed the public opinion from negative to positive, support this hypothesis. Analysing acceptability and attitudes in Stockholm allows us to study a situation where the population is in fact familiar with congestion charges, and explore what the decisive factors for acceptability are in such a situation. By analysing a survey collected after the referendum and the subsequent reintroduction of the charges, we analyse the prerequisites to achieve acceptability given that the public is familiar with congestion charges. As expected, low car dependence and good transit supply are associated with high acceptability. But the two most important factors turn out to be beliefs about the charges' effectiveness, and general environmental attitudes. The importance of beliefs and perceptions of the effects of the charges underscores the importance of both careful system design and careful evaluation and results communication. The strong connection between environmental concerns and positive attitudes to congestion charges underscores the importance of considering and “marketing” the charges' environmental effects. In Stockholm, the politicians' decision to “re-label” the congestion charges to “environmental charges” and emphasising their positive effects on air quality may very well have had a positive impact on acceptability.},

The system is similar to the system introduced in Stockholm in 2006; both are designed as time-of-day dependent cordon pricing systems. We find that many effects and adaptation strategies are similar to those found in Stockholm, indicating a high transferability between smaller and larger cities with substantial differences in public transport use. However, there are also important differences regarding some of the effects, the accuracy of the model forecasts and public support arising from different topologies, public transport use, congestion levels and main objectives communicated to the public. Finally, the Gothenburg case suggests that whether congestion charges are introduced or not depends on the support among the political parties, and that this is determined primarily by the prevailing institutional setting and power over revenues, and to a lower extent by the public support, and benefits from congestion reduction.},

abstract = {The implementation of road pricing has been limited worldwide despite the notion that road pricing is generally considered to be a potentially effective measure to reduce externalities, in particular traffic congestion. By means of a content analysis of 106 scientific papers, this paper aims to identify and compare the detailed set of implementation factors for the four implemented road pricing cases of Singapore, London, Stockholm and the Norwegian cities, and the two not implemented cases of Hong Kong and Edinburgh. Policy implementation lessons are formulated to aid local and national authorities considering the implementation of road pricing. In contrast to other studies, this paper identifies a broad set of implementation factors for each empirical case (an average of 36). The cases have six generic implementation factors in common, the most prominent being political and public support. However, the generic factors only account for on average 27{\%} of all the implementation factors listed. Consequently, authorities aiming to implement road pricing also need to take many case specific factors into account in the implementation process. Furthermore, the six cases show that policy implementation will only be successful when many factors positively contribute to the process which explains why it is such a precarious endeavour.},

abstract = {Cambridge is a small free standing city in the UK with a population of 105 000. In recent years it has endured a worsening congestion problem essentially as a result of employment growth within the city and the narrow street layout. This is not a unique problem but one which is particularly acute in historic cities. In 1990, Congestion Metering was advanced, in addition to a number of other measures, as a means of managing traffic demand within the city. It has generated a great deal of interest internationally, particularly the field trial which took place in October 1993. This was the first time that any form of road pricing had been demonstrated practically in the UK. The aim of this article is to provide a review, establishing why the idea of Congestion Metering was originally considered and why, at least in the short to medium term, it is unlikely to be implemented in a Cambridge context. The process by which, if adopted, it is envisaged that Congestion Metering would be introduced is outlined, and the relative merits and potential weaknesses of such a demand management measure. Finally, the author considers the real problem of 'public scepticism' which needs to be addressed if Congestion Metering is to avoid the pitfalls which have bedevilled other road pricing schemes world-wide.},

The Report detailed seventeen requirements for a road pricing system, which were seen as either important or desirable. These requirements are as relevant today as they which have failed to advance beyond the drawing board. One scheme that has been successfully implemented recently in Malta is the Valletta road pricing scheme, referred to as the Controlled Vehicular Access (CVA) system. The aim of this paper is to compare the Valletta scheme against the requirements for a road pricing system outlined in the Smeed Report (hereinafter referred to as the Smeed Requirements), with the intention of ascertaining whether there are any lessons that can be learnt which are of benefit to those, world-wide, considering the introduction of a road pricing scheme.},

The story of how this happened is of great interest, for it shows how EU regulations, scientific evidence and political action at the local level have concurred to bring about change in the city's transport policy. Unlike the well-known cases of London and Stockholm, it is concerns for the levels of pollution (rather than congestion) that have led to the introduction of the “Ecopass” scheme in 2008. Accordingly, in the following years the public debate has focused on the effectiveness of this pollution charge in reducing PM10 – a pollutant with adverse health impacts. Based on the analysis of media coverage and official reports, this paper argues that EU regulations had a crucial role in determining the newsworthiness of PM10 in Milan. Media},

abstract = {The paper develops a set of analytical formulations to study the behavior of the urban delivery industry in response to cordon time-of-day pricing, time-distance pricing, and comprehensive financial policies targeting carriers and receivers. This is accomplished by modeling the behavior of receivers in response to financial incentives, and the ensuing behavior of the carrier in response to both pricing and the receivers' decisions concerning off-hour deliveries. The analytical formulations consider both the base case condition, and a mixed operation with both regular hour and off-hour deliveries; two pricing schemes: cordon time of day, and time-distance pricing; two types of operations: single-tour, and multi-tour carriers; and three different scenarios in terms of profitability of the carrier operation, which include an approximation to the best case, the expected value, and the worst case. The analyses, both theoretical and numerical, highlight the limitations of pricing-only approaches. In the case of cordon time of day pricing, the chief conclusion is that it is of limited use as a freight demand management tool because: (1) in a competitive market the cordon toll cannot be transferred to the receivers as it is a fixed cost and (2) the structure of the cost function, that only provides an incentive to the carrier to switch to the off-hours when all the receivers in the tour switch to the off-hours. The analyses of time-distance pricing clearly indicate that, though its tolls could be transferred to the receivers and provide an incentive for behavior change, the magnitude of the expected toll transfers under real life conditions are too small to have any meaningful impact on receivers choice of delivery times. In essence, the key policy implication is that in order to change the joint behavior of carrier and receivers, financial incentives-or programs that foster unassisted off-hour deliveries-should be made available to receivers in exchange for their commitment to do off-hour deliveries. As the paper proves, if a meaningful number of receivers switch to the off-hours, the carriers are likely to follow suit. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although the theoretical influence on the number and severity of traffic accidents is ambiguous, we show that the policy generated a substantial reduction in both the number of accidents and in the accident rate. At the same time, the spatial, temporal and vehicle specific nature of the charge may cause unintended substitutions as traffic and accidents shift to other proximate areas, times and to uncharged vehicles. We demonstrate that, to the contrary, the congestion charge reduced accidents and the accident rate in adjacent areas, times and for uncharged vehicles. These results are consistent with the government's objective to use the congestion charge to more broadly promote public transport and change driving habits.},

abstract = {In 2000, the average driver in US metropolitan areas endured 27 hours of traffic delays, a rise from 7 hours in 1980. In many other countries, traffic delays are considerably worse than in the United States, and in developing countries urban traffic congestion is increasing with alarming rapidity. For fifty years, economists have been advocating congestion pricing as the way to deal with urban traffic congestion; but today, even after some successes, congestion pricing is encountering considerable political resistance. The authors of Alleviating Urban Traffic Congestion advocate active consideration of more microscopic policies that attack the problem at the scale at which actual policy decisions are made. Microscopic models, rather than macroscopic models that are too simplified and too aggregated, they argue, will lead to the analysis of a wider and more creative range of policies, at least some of which should work well and be politically acceptable. After developing the themes of the book, the authors illustrate them by examining some areas of urban transport policy that have been neglected by the macroscopic approach. These include downtown parking policy, the encouragement of bicycling, the staggering of work hours by dominant employers, and the use by medium-sized cities of a "multimode" ticket that charges cars entering the city center a toll equal to the transit fare. The reorientation of urban transport analysis that they advocate will by no means eliminate traffic delays but should speed up the adoption of a richer, more flexible, and ultimately more effective set of policies to alleviate urban traffic congestion.},

abstract = {With increasing worldwide interest in the application of urban road pricing, the experience of Singapore can be very useful. Under the Singapore Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system, charges for entering the city centre and using some expressways vary by time of day and are being periodically revised in order to maintain traffic speeds within the desirable bands. Traffic response to these revisions shows that demand elasticity with respect to pricing is higher for cars than for other vehicles and higher for expressways than for the city centre cordon. It is also lower in the morning peak and higher in the afternoon. A discrete choice based model of motorist response to pricing is proposed for a single toll point with peak period variable pricing. The choices considered include the time interval of travel and re-routing to avoid the toll. The model was calibrated for one expressway and two arterial roads using only traffic volume data collected before and after ERP introduction. The model reflected well the peak spreading effect of variable road pricing and the penalties for rescheduling and re-routing of trips. In general, the Singapore experience suggests that variable pricing is an effective method of controlling congestion.},

abstract = {AbstractIn early 2008, a pollution charge was introduced in the central area of Milan. Although initially it positively affected traffic volume, after some years its effect wore off due to the replacement of older vehicles with newer and exempt vehicles. As effectiveness decreased, in June 2011 the Milan citizens voted in a referendum on whether to extend the charge to all vehicles. The result was clearly in favour of the redesign and extension of the toll. In January 2012 the new policy was put in force under the name of ‘Area C'. The new pricing uses the same technological infrastructure and encompasses the same area, but evolves into congestion pricing aimed at reducing traffic in the compact and crowded central city.The present paper discusses the history of the Milan road-pricing case and presents some quantitative analyses of the overall effectiveness of the measure, based on official data. In addition, we calculate, using cordon data, also the distribution of entrances per vehicle category and the ...},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper aims to estimate the effect of road pricing on the composition of traffic. By considering the case of Milan, where a charge to enter the city centre was introduced in 2008, and by relying on an unexpected and temporary suspension of the tax, we analyse the effect of the policy on flows of vehicles classified by type of engine. We have found that a road pricing scheme shifted users from Euro 0–3 vehicles (i.e., those vehicles particularly polluting according to the European Emission Standards classification and produced before 2000–2001) to liquefied petroleum gas, bi-fuel and hybrid vehicles. However, the environmental benefits of the policy were limited by a substantial increase in the usage of motorbikes. This evidence calls for a consideration of the behavioural reactions of road users when making ex ante evaluations of the social profitability of road pricing schemes.},

abstract = {The role of various types of road user tolls has been an important part of Norwegian transport development for a number of years. There are now around 50 such projects in operation around the country. This paper examines the urban toll ring projects and presents results from new research into the schemes in Norway's three largest cities: Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim. The research indicates that key decisions are being debated as to whether the schemes will continue as toll rings, be stopped completely or transformed into more of a demand management style policy. Interviews with road and local authorities have shown that the feelings are mixed and that the decision will depend on various transport, social, organisational and political factors. This paper reviews the cases of Bergen, Oslo and Trondheim and documents the latest developments in each scheme. The theory behind the application of the toll rings is explored through the case studies. Despite all the projects being implemented by similar networks, each scheme developed its own individual characteristics. These are laid alongside the economic and transport benefits with which they have been associated. The Strategic Policy Niche Management framework is used to analyse various aspects of the toll projects and identify key lessons. The effect these might have on future UK projects is also discussed.},

We show that the traffic reduction caused by the charges has increased slightly over time, once external factors are controlled for. Alternative fuel vehicles were exempt from the charges through 2008, and we show that this substantially increased the sales of such vehicles. We discuss public and political acceptability, synthesising recent research and Swedish experience. We conclude that objective and subjective effects on the traffic system, as well as general environmental and political attitudes, formed the basis of the strong public support, while institutional reforms and resolution of power issues were necessary to gain political support. Finally, we briefly discuss implications for the transport planning process in general.},

One important result from Electronic Road Pricing in Singapore is that a per entry charge is more effective at reducing congestion than a perday charge. It is concluded that although Electronic Road Pricing in Singapore is more in line with the desirable properties outlined in the Smeed Report, both schemes are part of a wider package of transport policies, and that is probably the most important reason for their success.

However, surveys of those designing such schemes indicate that they are opting for the simplest designs, in the interest of acceptability, and may well be overlooking designs which achieve greater economic benefit. A set of analytical procedures has been developed for identifying the locations for imposing charges and the charges at those points which are optimal in terms of economic efficiency. These are demonstrated on a simplified network of Cambridge. Tests on a larger network confirm that performance is very sensitive to cordon location. However, they also show that charging points selected by even a simple analytical procedure can achieve economic benefits around 50{\%} higher than predefined cordons, and that relaxing the requirement to have uniform charges at all charging points can produce further substantial increases in economic benefits. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The paper attempts first to outline the reasons why the city of Cambridge presented an ideal opportunity for the implementation of some form of urban road pricing scheme, with the level of congestion experienced and the nature of the city itself being central issues, and second, why congestion metering failed to advance beyond the field trial. In this respect its timing and level of sophistication can be viewed as important contributing factors. In order to further the debate interviews were undertaken over the period May to June 1996 with 21 local actors, namely politicians and officials who had direct contact with and knowledge of congestion metering in Cambridge between October 1990 and October 1993. That was the period of time over which congestion metering was being considered in Cambridge.

abstract = {Background. Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban areas in the United States and around the world. Previous analyses have estimated the economic costs of congestion, related to fuel and time wasted, but few have quantified the public health impacts or determined how these impacts compare in magnitude to the economic costs. Moreover, the relative magnitudes of economic and public health impacts of congestion would be expected to vary significantly across urban areas, as a function of road infrastructure, population density, and atmospheric conditions influencing pollutant formation, but this variability has not been explored. Methods. In this study, we evaluate the public health impacts of ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations associated with a business-as-usual scenario of predicted traffic congestion. We evaluate 83 individual urban areas using traffic demand models to estimate the degree of congestion in each area from 2000 to 2030. We link traffic volume and speed data with the MOBILE6 model to characterize emissions of PM2.5and particle precursors attributable to congestion, and we use a source-receptor matrix to evaluate the impact of these emissions on ambient PM2.5concentrations. Marginal concentration changes are related to a concentration-response function for mortality, with a value of statistical life approach used to monetize the impacts. Results. We estimate that the monetized value of PM2.5-related mortality attributable to congestion in these 83 cities in 2000 was approximately {\$}31 billion (2007 dollars), as compared with a value of time and fuel wasted of {\$}60 billion. In future years, the economic impacts grow (to over {\$}100 billion in 2030) while the public health impacts decrease to {\$}13 billion in 2020 before increasing to {\$}17 billion in 2030, given increasing population and congestion but lower emissions per vehicle. Across cities and years, the public health impacts range from more than an order of magnitude less to in excess of the economic impacts. Conclusions. Our analyses indicate that the public health impacts of congestion may be significant enough in magnitude, at least in some urban areas, to be considered in future evaluations of the benefits of policies to mitigate congestion. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2010 Levy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Li2002,
abstract = {The paper aims to address the practical relevance of each of three empirical elements, namely, the speed-flow relationship, the demand function and the generalized cost that affect the implementation of a congestion pricing system. We first derive the theoretical congestion toll estimate for a class of speed-flow relationship known as the generalized Drake model. We then propose an iterative procedure to pinpoint the optimal congestion toll based on a speed-flow relationship and a value of the generalized cost in the absence of a demand function. Several practical implications will be highlighted concerning, in particular, the treatment of peak and off-peak congestion pricing. For the role of the generalized cost, we show that, in the absence of a demand function, an inaccurate value of the generalized cost will almost always lead to non-optimal, but convergent outcome. A practical implication of this "false convergence" is that a rough estimate of the generalized cost will be sufficient to obtain a congestion toll that is quite close to the optimal toll value by realizing that a speed-flow relationship is just an average relationship that is subject to certain degree of variations. We conclude the paper by applying these results to Singapore's road pricing system. Generic distance-based toll estimation tables are given for the purpose of checking the optimality of actual congestion tolls on the expressways and the restricted zone (RZ) when the information on the observed traffic situation and the value of the generalized cost become available. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Hamilton2011,
abstract = {In January 2006, a system for congestion charging was introduced in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. The charging scheme was run in the form of a full-scale trial for seven months, after which it was deactivated, awaiting its evaluation and an advisory public referendum. Several parties, including representatives of the scientific community as well as media and special interest groups, have analysed and evaluated the system. A recurring theme in several of these analyses is that the cost to build and operate the system was excessive, compared to costs for other road charging installations. This study revisits some of the key project participants and archive data, to provide a deeper understanding of what were the major cost drivers and whether lower cost can be achieved in future installations. The approach taken is to emphasise understanding of the particular circumstances rather than comparing aggregates with other seemingly similar systems. The main conclusions include the identification of a rational actor paying an insurance against unacceptable risk, the importance of the election cycle, and the interplay between risk, acceptance, performance, and cost. A conceptual model for this interaction is suggested.},

abstract = {The paper reports the results of a series of studies conducted to enable the London Planning Advisory Committee to provide advice on strategic transport policy for London. The analytical approach combined the use of an area-based, multi-modal strategic model (LAM) and professional judgment. The performance of LAM as a basis for providing rapid advice on complex issues in transport policy is assessed. The resulting policy advice advocated a coherent approach, involving new infrastructure, particularly for rail; improved management of the road and public transport networks; the use of subsidy to enhance public transport service levels; and road user charges to reduce the impact of private vehicles on congestion and the environment. Road user charges emerged as the pivotal issue in the policy; the paper discusses their role, and the questions which still need to be resolved before they can be implemented. The main message of the study is that no one element of transport policy can tackle London's problems alone; an integrated policy in which infrastructure provision, manage- ment and pricing are used to complement one another is shown to be far more effective.},

The most important data sources are travel time and traffic flow measurements made in the year before the charges were introduced (during April 2005) and during the first spring with the charges (during April 2006, 4 months after the charges were introduced). Using matrix calibration, effects on the non-observed link flows and travel times are extrapolated, enabling us to calculate the social value of changes in travel times and travel costs. Impacts on traffic safety and emissions are calculated using standard Swedish CBA relationships. The system is shown to yield a significant social surplus, well enough to cover both investment and operating costs, provided that it is kept for a reasonable lifetime: investment and startup costs are “recovered” in terms of social benefits in around 4 years.},

In most of the health impact assessment literature, investigators have reported on long- and short-term effects of air pollution. Here the authors present results of a health impact assessment of short-term effects of particulate matter ≤10 $\mu$m in diameter (PM(10)) in the Lombardy region of Italy (2003-2006). The impact was evaluated in terms of numbers of attributable deaths under several counterfactual scenarios of air pollution reduction based on World Health Organization guidelines and European Union limits. The authors found that annual average PM(10) levels exceeding the World Health Organization threshold of 20 $\mu$g/m(3) and the European Union limit of 40 $\mu$g/m(3) were responsible for 302 and 109 attributable deaths per year, corresponding to attributable community rates of 13 and 5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants per year, respectively. A 20{\%} reduction in existing PM(10) levels could reduce by more than 30{\%} the burden of short-term deaths linked to ambient air pollution. Therefore, policies for air pollution reduction appear to be necessary in order to protect and improve individual and community health.},

However, only a few locations have actually decided to use this mechanism, with Valletta one of the more recent cities to introduce such a scheme. This paper aims to present a case study of road pricing in Valletta and the role played by policy transfer in its introduction. To do this, it applies data gathered from existing literature, in-depth interviews and direct observation with those involved in the policy development. Experience of road pricing was gained from London, Durham, Edinburgh and Stockholm. One of the major barriers to policy transfer was felt to be the unique geography of the island however international events, local conditions and a political champion driving change were critical factors to the successful implementation of the road pricing scheme. Policy transfer was deemed useful in terms of policy development, relations with stakeholders, scheme design and administrative approaches. This paper concludes by identifying the contributions of the case study of Valletta to the policy transfer literature.},

abstract = {This paper compares forecast effects of the Stockholm congestion charges with actual outcomes. The most important concerns during the design of the congestion charging scheme were the traffic reduction in bottlenecks, the increase in public transport ridership, the decrease of vehicle kilometres in the city centre, and potential traffic effects on circumferential roads. Comparisons of forecasts and actual outcomes show that the transport model predicted all of these factors well enough to allow planners to draw correct conclusions regarding the design and preparations for the scheme. The one major shortcoming was that the static assignment network model was unable to predict the substantial reductions of queuing times. We conclude that the transport model worked well enough to be useful as decision support, performing considerably better than unaided "experts' judgments", but that results must be interpreted taking the model's limitations into account. The positive experiences from the Stockholm congestion charges hence seem to be transferable to other cities in the sense that if a charging system is forecast to have beneficial effects on congestion, then this is most likely true. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aims of this paper are to identify the reasons why a fixed charge was initially introduced; to review the literature related to implementation of road user charging schemes around the world; to compare the V-licence with the CVA and identify the issues relating to the change from one scheme to another.
