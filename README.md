repo for "Downtown Tolls and the Distribution of Trip Lengths"

This repository contains the simulation code, Latex source and bibliography for Lewis Lehe's paper Downtown Tolls and the Distribution of Trip Lengths*, published in the journal **Economics of Transportation.**

The simulation is contained in simulation.jl. The code is written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language, version 0.6.0. The code is used to produce the plots and table used in the numerical simulation part of the paper. The code is fairly well documented, and attempting to run the code will prompt the user to install the appropriate packages. Even if the user is not familiar with the Julia language, it should be obvious how to code the equivalent program in another language---especially Python or MatLab, to which Julia bears a strong resemblance visually. The language includes types, which should help make the code comprehensible even to the non-user.
