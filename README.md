# Downtown Tolls and the Distribution of Trip Lengths

This repository contains the simulation code, Latex source and bibliography for Lewis Lehe's paper *Downtown Tolls and the Distribution of Trip Lengths*, published in **Economics of Transportation.**

The file simulations.jl, above, is written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language, version 0.6.0, and is used to produce the plots and table used in the numerical simulation part of the paper. The code is documented via comments. Even if the user is not familiar with the Julia language, it should be obvious how to code the equivalent program in another language---especially Python or MatLab, to which Julia bears a strong resemblance visually. The language includes types, which should help make the code comprehensible even to the non-user.
