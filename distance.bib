abstract = {Four road pricing systems, with charges based on cordons crossed, distance travelled, time spent travelling and time spent in congestion, have been tested using the congested assignment network model SATURN and its elastic assignment demand response routine, SATEASY. All tests have been based on a SATURN application of the city of Cambridge, with charges imposed inside an appropriate ring of bypasses. While initial results showed that congestion pricing achieved the greatest increase in average speed in the charged area, later analysis cast doubt on its superiority. Congestion pricing is able to distinguish more effectively the extent to which different types of journey contribute to congestion and achieves given reductions in travel at lower levels of charge. However, it is much less effective in reducing distance travelled and, by encouraging use of minor roads, may achieve far smaller environmental benefits. Time-based pricing performs better than the other systems on most indicators. Generally, the results suggest that when rerouting effects are included in the predictive modelling process the benefits of road pricing may be significantly smaller than previously expected.},

abstract = {This study explores the limiting properties of network-wide traffic flow relations under heavily congested conditions in a large-scale complex urban street network; these limiting conditions are emulated in the context of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) experiments on an actual large network. The primary objectives are to characterize gridlock and understand its dynamics. This study addresses a gap in the literature with regard to the existence of exit flow and recovery period. The one-dimensional theoretical Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) only represents steady-state behavior and holds only when the inputs change slowly in time and traffic is distributed homogenously in space. Also, it does not describe the hysteretic behavior of the network traffic when a gridlock forms or when network recovers. Thus, a model is proposed to reproduce hysteresis and gridlock when homogeneity and steady-state conditions do not hold. It is conjectured that the network average flow can be approximated as a non-linear function of network average density and variation in link densities. The proposed model is calibrated for the Chicago Central Business District (CBD) network. We also show that complex urban networks with multiple route choices, similar to the idealized network tested previously in the literature, tend to jam at a range of densities that are smaller than the theoretical average network jam density. Also it is demonstrated that networks tend to gridlock in many different ways with different configurations. This study examines how mobility of urban street networks could be improved by managing vehicle accumulation and redistributing network traffic via strategies such as demand management and disseminating real-time traveler information (adaptive driving). This study thus defines and explores some key characteristics and dynamics of urban street network gridlocks including gridlock formation, propagation, recovery, size, etc. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A field experiment in Yokohama (Japan) reveals that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean flow, density and speed exists on a large urban area. The experiment used a combination of fixed detectors and floating vehicle probes as sensors. It was observed that when the somewhat chaotic scatter-plots of speed vs. density from individual fixed detectors were aggregated the scatter nearly disappeared and points grouped neatly along a smoothly declining curve. This evidence suggests, but does not prove, that an MFD exists for the complete network because the fixed detectors only measure conditions in their proximity, which may not represent the whole network. Therefore, the analysis was enriched with data from GPS-equipped taxis, which covered the entire network. The new data were filtered to ensure that only full-taxi trips (i.e., representative of automobile trips) were retained in the sample. The space-mean speeds and densities at different times-of-day were then estimated for the whole study area using relevant parts of the detector and taxi data sets. These estimates were still found to lie close to a smoothly declining curve with deviations smaller than those of individual links - and entirely explained by experimental error. The analysis also revealed a fixed relation between the space-mean flows on the whole network, which are easy to estimate given the existence of an MFD, and the trip completion rates, which dynamically measure accessibility. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{DePalma2005a,
abstract = {Much of the road pricing literature has focused on deriving second-best optimal tolls when only parts of a network can be tolled or tolling is constrained in other ways. A drawback of second-best tolling is that it requires extensive information on speed-flow curves and demand elasticities throughout the network. Such information is often not readily available, and errors in estimating key parameters could result in tolls that are nonoptimal or even welfare reducing. The purpose of this paper is to explore a simpler alternative policy, dubbed "no-queue" tolling, whereby time-varying tolls are imposed selectively on a road network with the objective of eliminating queuing on the tolled links. No-queue tolling is an example of third-best pricing because the effects of the tolls on other links are disregarded. To explore the merits of no-queue tolling, a dynamic traffic simulator (METROPOLIS) was used to compute no-queue tolls for individual links and cordon rings on a laboratory network. For comparison, second-best flat and time-varying tolls were also computed on the same sets of links. Two results stood out. First, even without accounting for the likely computational and acceptability advantages of no-queue tolling, it appeared to dominate flat tolling and performed relatively well compared to step tolling. Second, the benefits from no-queue tolling exhibited approximately constant returns with respect to the number of links that are tolled. This suggests that no-queue tolling could fruitfully be selectively implemented now, rather than waiting a decade or more for comprehensive road pricing to become feasible.},

The trip price must increase to ration the increased demand, but how? These questions have been the subject of a debate in transport economic theory dating back to Walters' classic paper (1961). The current wisdom is that the facility continues to operate at full capacity, with travel at reduced velocity and/or increased queuing serving to increase the trip price. This paper analyzes the transient dynamics and stability of steady states for a spatially uniform road network with on-street parking, and finds in this context that the increase in demand may cause operation at reduced throughput. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The gradually accelerating pace at which tolls are being implemented or actively considered around the world suggests that road pricing is an idea whose time may finally have come. Nevertheless, various design considerations must be addressed and public acceptability hurdles overcome if road pricing is to become widespread. And to measure the efficiency gains and welfare-distributional effects of road pricing accurately, models need to account for potential behavioural responses to tolls—and in particular adjustments in trip timing. This paper analyzes some road pricing schemes using the dynamic network simulator METROPOLIS: a tool that treats endogenously departure-time decisions as well as mode and route choices of individual travelers. Simulations are conducted for a stylized urban road network that consists of radial arterials and circumferential ring roads, and with trip origins and destinations that are distributed throughout the network. Six types of link-tolling schemes are analyzed: (1) the system optimum which can be supported approximately by imposing time-varying step tolls that eliminate queuing, (2) a set of comprehensive flat (time-independent) tolls, (3,4) second-best flat and step tolls for a toll cordon, and (5,6) second-best flat and step tolls within a charge area. Two results show the superiority of step tolls over flat tolls. First, step tolls easily outperform flat tolls in terms of welfare gains while inducing a smaller shift of trips from auto to transit. Second, step tolls generate smaller revenues than do flat tolls, and consequently have more favourable distributional impacts on travelers.},

Next, the implications for static models of 'peak congestion' are considered. In doing so, attention is paid also to the implicit assumptions, particularly on the nature of scheduling costs, that are necessary to render static models of peak congestion internally consistent.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper suggests that the conventional approach to the theory of optimal congestion taxes is open to question, and shows how it might be reformulated. It argues that taxes should be based on the marginal cost of adding to the number of vehicles on a road, rather than of adding to the traffic flow. When proper account is taken of the costs imposed on following traffic, the optimal congestion tax becomes a more complex concept than has previously been supposed, depending on such factors as the existing duration of congestion as well as existing traffic flows. /// Diese Schrift stellt die hergebrachten Annahmen zur Theorie der optimalen Stauungsbesteuerung zur Frage und zeigt an, wie diese umformuliert werden k{\"{o}}nnten.

Congestion is modeled with a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram relating the space-mean speed of a network to the vehicular accumulation. It is shown for a large class of scheduling preferences that if users have continuously distributed characteristics, the network accumulation at equilibrium is a continuous function of time. With $\alpha$ - $\beta$ - $\gamma$ preferences and under certain conditions, a partial First-In, First-Out (FIFO) pattern emerges at equilibrium among early and late users. This FIFO pattern is strict only within families of users having heterogeneous trip lengths and identical preferences, or vice versa.

Under optimal cordon pricing, trips originating from locations inside the cordon are under-priced, those just outside the cordon are over-priced and those near the urban fringe are under-priced.

But this is counter to experience, especially in the downtown areas of major cities during rush hour. This paper analyzes a bathtub model of downtown rush-hour traffic congestion that builds on ideas put forward by William Vickrey. Water flowing into the bathtub corresponds to cars entering the traffic stream, water flowing out of the bathtub to cars exiting from it, and the height of water in the bathtub to traffic density. Velocity is negatively related to density, and outflow is proportional to the product of density and velocity. Above a critical density, outflow falls as density increases (traffic jam situations). When demand is high relative to capacity, applying an optimal time-varying toll generates benefits that may be considerably larger than those obtained from standard models and that exceed the toll revenue collected.},

abstract = {Designing a congestion pricing scheme involves a number of complex decisions. Focusing on the quantitative parts of a congestion pricing system with link tolls, the problem involves finding the number of toll links, the link toll locations and their corresponding toll level and schedule. In this paper, we develop and evaluate methods for finding the most efficient design for a congestion pricing scheme in a road network model with elastic demand. The design efficiency is measured by the net social surplus, which is computed as the difference between the social surplus and the collection costs (i.e. setup and operational costs) of the congestion pricing system. The problem of finding such a scheme is stated as a combinatorial bi-level optimization problem. At the upper level, we maximize the net social surplus and at the lower level we solve a user equilibrium problem with elastic demand, given the toll locations and toll levels, to simulate the user response. We modify a known heuristic procedure for finding the optimal locations and toll levels given a fixed number of tolls to locate, to find the optimal number of toll facilities as well. A new heuristic procedure, based on repeated solutions of a continuous approximation of the combinatorial problem is also presented. Numerical results for two small test networks are presented. Both methods perform satisfactorily on the two networks. Comparing the two methods, we find that the continuous approximation procedure is the one which shows the best results.},

abstract = {A field experiment in Yokohama (Japan) revealed that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean flow, density and speed exists on a large urban area. It was observed that when the highly scattered plots of flow vs. density from individual fixed detectors were aggregated the scatter nearly disappeared and points grouped along a well defined curve. Despite these and other recent findings for the existence of well-defined MFDs for urban areas, these MFDs should not be universally expected. In this paper we investigate what are the properties that a network should satisfy, so that an MFD with low scatter exists. We show that the spatial distribution of vehicle density in the network is one of the key components that affect the scatter of an MFD and its shape. We also propose an analytical derivation of the spatial distribution of congestion that considers correlation between adjacent links. We investigate the scatter of an MFD in terms of errors in the probability density function of spatial link occupancy and errors of individual links' fundamental diagram (FD). Later, using real data from detectors for an urban arterial and a freeway network we validate the proposed derivations and we show that an MFD is not well defined in freeway networks as hysteresis effects are present. The datasets in this paper consist of flow and occupancy measures from 500 fixed sensors in the Yokohama downtown area in Japan and 600 loop detectors in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Freeway network in Minnesota, USA. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The basic idea consists in monitoring and controlling aggregate vehicular accumulations at the neighborhood level. To do this, physical models of the gridlock phenomenon are presented both for single neighborhoods and for systems of inter-connected neighborhoods. The models are dynamic, aggregate and only require observable inputs. The latter can be obtained in real-time if the neighborhoods are properly instrumented. Therefore, the models can be used for adaptive control. Experiments should determine accuracy. Pareto-efficient strategies are shown to exist for the single-neighborhood case, and optimality principles are introduced for multi-neighborhood systems.

abstract = {Congestion pricing schemes have been traditionally derived based on analytical representations of travel demand and traffic flows, such as in bottleneck models. A major limitation of these models, especially when applied to urban networks, is the inconsistency with traffic dynamics and related phenomena such as hysteresis and the capacity drop. In this study we propose a new method to derive time-varying tolling schemes using the concept of the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). The adopted method is based on marginal cost pricing, while it also enables to account realistically for the dynamics of large and heterogeneous traffic networks. We derive two alternative cordon tolls using network-aggregated traffic flow conditions: a step toll that neglects the spatial distribution of traffic by simply associating the marginal costs of any decrease in production within the NFD to the surplus of traffic; and a step toll that explicitly accounts for how network performance is also influenced by the spatial variance in a 3D-NFD. This pricing framework is implemented in the agent-based simulation model MATSim and applied to a case study of the city of Zurich. The tolling schemes are compared with a uniform toll, and they highlight how the inhomogeneous distribution of traffic may compromise the effectiveness of cordon tolls.},

After an implementation/adjustment of a congestion pricing scheme, the network flows in a certain period of days are not on an equilibrium state, thus it is problematic to take the equilibrium-based indexes as the pricing objective. Therefore, the concept of robust optimization is taken for the congestion toll determination problem, which takes into account the network performance of each day. First, a minimax model which minimizes the maximum regret on each day is proposed. Taking as a constraint of the minimax model, a path-based day to day dynamics model under stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) constraints is discussed in this paper. It is difficult to solve this minimax model by exact algorithms because of the implicity of the flow map function. Hence, a two-phase artificial bee colony algorithm is developed to solve the proposed minimax regret model, of which the first phase solves the minimal expected total travel cost for each day and the second phase handles the minimax robust optimization problem. Finally, a numerical example is conducted to validate the proposed models and methods.},

This situation can be described as queuing behind a bottleneck whose capacity declines when the queue is large. We combine such a variable-capacity bottleneck with Vickrey scheduling preferences for the special case, where there are only two possible levels of capacity. Solving the model leads to several new insights, including that the marginal cost of adding a traveler is especially sensitive to the lowest level of capacity reached. We analyze an optimal toll, a coarse toll, and metering, showing substantial benefits from using these policies to eliminate the period of reduced capacity.

Characteristic features of the resulting theory are a simple "graph-shearing" process for following the development of traffic waves in time and the frequent appearance of shock waves. The effect of a traffic signal on traffic streams is studied and found to exhibit a threshold effect wherein the disturbances are minor for light traffic but suddenly build to large values when a critical density is exceeded.},

abstract = {With increasing worldwide interest in the application of urban road pricing, the experience of Singapore can be very useful. Under the Singapore Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system, charges for entering the city centre and using some expressways vary by time of day and are being periodically revised in order to maintain traffic speeds within the desirable bands. Traffic response to these revisions shows that demand elasticity with respect to pricing is higher for cars than for other vehicles and higher for expressways than for the city centre cordon. It is also lower in the morning peak and higher in the afternoon. A discrete choice based model of motorist response to pricing is proposed for a single toll point with peak period variable pricing. The choices considered include the time interval of travel and re-routing to avoid the toll. The model was calibrated for one expressway and two arterial roads using only traffic volume data collected before and after ERP introduction. The model reflected well the peak spreading effect of variable road pricing and the penalties for rescheduling and re-routing of trips. In general, the Singapore experience suggests that variable pricing is an effective method of controlling congestion.},

abstract = {The morning commute problem for a single bottleneck, introduced in Vickrey (1969), is extended to model mode choice in an urban area with time-dependent demand. This extension recognizes that street space is shared by cars and public transit. It is assumed that transit is operated independently of traffic conditions, and that when it is operated it consumes a fixed amount of space.As a first step, a single fixed-capacity bottleneck that can serve both cars and transit is studied. Commuters choose which mode to use and when to travel in order to minimize the generalized cost of their own trip. The transit agency chooses the headway and when to operate. Transit operations reduce the bottleneck's capacity for cars by a fixed amount. The following results are shown for this type of bottleneck:. 1.If the transit agency charges a fixed fare and operates at a given headway, and only when there is demand, then there is a unique user equilibrium.2.If the transit agency chooses its headway and time of operation for the common good, and users choose when to travel for the common good, then there is a system optimum solution with less cost and no queuing.3.Time-dependent tolls and fares that achieve this system optimum are given.Finally, it is also shown that Results 2 and 3 apply to urban networks that serve a demand which is distributed in time and space, and which may include a population of captive transit riders. It is found that in many cases, additional transit service should be provided during a specified period in the rush. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper considers a signalized street of uniform width and blocks of various lengths. Its signals are pretimed in an arbitrary pattern, and traffic on it behaves as per the kinematic-wave/variational theory with a triangular fundamental diagram. It is shown that the long run average flow on the street when the number of cars on the street (i.e. the street's density) is held constant is given by the solution of a linear program (LP) with a finite number of variables and constraints. This defines a point on the street's macroscopic fundamental diagram. For the homogeneous special case where the block lengths and signal timings are identical, all the LP constraints but one are redundant and the result has a closed form. In this case, the LP recipe matches and simplifies the so-called “method of cuts”. This establishes that the method of cuts is exact for homogeneous problems. However, in the more realistic inhomogeneous case the difference between the two methods can be arbitrarily large.},

The results have indicated that the average flow in a street network may indeed be expressed as the product of the space mean speed and concentration. Simultaneous ground experiments have also been conducted in the Austin CBD to investigate the reasonableness of the assumptions of the "two-fluid model," a curvilinear relation between the trip time and stop time per unit distance, which may be used in characterizing the quality of traffic service in urban street networks. As a result of these simultaneous ground experiments and aerial observations, the assumptions of the model have been verified. Moreover, relations between the fraction of vehicles stopped and concentration as well as between speed and concentration have allowed the two-fluid model to be used to compare the quality of traffic service in various street networks under the same level of concentration. The two-fluid model may then be used to predict, for a given change in vehicular concentration in a street network, the resulting changes in the averages of speed, fraction of vehicles stopped, flow, etc. This is particularly useful as a performance model in urban planning where for a given concentration it is desirable to predict the resulting traffic conditions.},

In the modelling process that followed, several approaches and mathematical models were studied. The final, recommended model relates journey speeds inside the Zone with the average traffic flow per lane inside the area which, in turn, is correlated with the cordon traffic volume.

We find using suitable transformations that only a single network parameter is required to characterize the DUE solution, the freeway to NMFD capacity ratio. We also show that the stability and convergence properties of this system are captured by the constant demand case, which corresponds to an autonomous dynamical system that admits analytical solutions. This solution is characterized by two critical accumulation values that determine if the steady state is in free-flow or gridlock, depending on the initial accumulation. Additionally, we also propose a continuum approximation to account for the spatial evolution of congestion, by including variable trip length and variable NMFD coverage area in the model. It is found that gridlock cannot happen and that the steady-state solution is independent of surface network parameters. These parameters do affect the rate of convergence to the steady-state solution, but convergence rates appear virtually identical when time is expressed in units of the NMFD free-flow travel time.},

abstract = {Urban street networks exhibit hypercongested traffic states in which flow and speed drop as vehicles crowd the network. An important feature of aggregate traffic models based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram is that the dynamics of congestion are represented in a physically realistic way. For peak demand in a city in which all travelers use cars, hypercongested states are known to be unstable in equilibrium. In real cities travelers are able to choose whether to use cars or public transit during a peak period. This paper presents a model of the equilibrium for cars and transit, recognizing that hypercongestion often arises when modes are not priced. It is shown that hypercongested traffic can be part of a stable, steady equilibrium state when cars and high-capacity transit are used simultaneously. The paper also shows that coordinated fixed prices for cars and transit can always prevent hypercongested traffic states from developing.},

@article{Zheng2012,
abstract = {Pricing is considered an effective management policy to reduce traffic congestion in transportation networks. In this paper we combine a macroscopic model of traffic congestion in urban networks with an agent-based simulator to study congestion pricing schemes. The macroscopic model, which has been tested with real data in previous studies, represents an accurate and robust approach to model the dynamics of congestion. The agent-based simulator can reproduce the complexity of travel behavior in terms of travelers' choices and heterogeneity. This integrated approach is superior to traditional pricing schemes. On one hand, traffic simulators (including car-following, lane-changing and route choice models) consider travel behavior, i.e. departure time choice, inelastic to the level of congestion. On the other hand, most congestion pricing models utilize supply models insensitive to demand fluctuations and non-stationary conditions. This is not consistent with the physics of traffic and the dynamics of congestion. Furthermore, works that integrate the above features in pricing models are assuming deterministic and homogeneous population characteristics. In this paper, we first demonstrate by case studies in Zurich urban road network, that the output of a agent-based simulator is consistent with the physics of traffic flow dynamics, as defined by a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). We then develop and apply a dynamic cordon-based congestion pricing scheme, in which tolls are controlled by an MFD. And we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme. Results show that by applying such a congestion pricing, (i) the savings of travel time at both aggregated and disaggregated level outweigh the costs of tolling, (ii) the congestion inside the cordon area is eased while no extra congestion is generated in the neighbor area outside the cordon, (iii) tolling has stronger impact on leisure-related activities than on work-related activities, as fewer agents who perform work-related activities changed their time plans. Future work can apply the same methodology to other network-based pricing schemes, such as area-based or distance-traveled-based pricing. Equity issues can be investigated more carefully, if provided with data such as income of agents. Value-of-time-dependent pricing schemes then can also be determined. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These variables include average speed, concentration, flow, the fraction of vehicles stopped in the network, and the two-fluid running time variables. Three alternative sets of interrelated models, each with a different starting postulate, are presented and tested in terms of their performance against a series of microscopic simulation runs corresponding to different concentration levels. In each model system, a different functional form is postulated for either the speed-concentration relation or the fraction of vehicles stopped versus concentration relation. The functional form for the other relation is then derived from the postulated model by invoking the two-fluid theory of town traffic. The models are calibrated and tested using the simulation results. The analysis indicates that the network-level traffic variables are interrelated in a manner similar to that captured by the traffic models established for individual road sections. In particular, a well-known linear speed-concentration model as well as a nonlinear alternative are found to be generally applicable at the network level.},

After many years of adding capacity in an attempt to reduce congestion, a number of transport and road authorities at national, regional and local level are seeking to move away from the centralist approach to roads policy to one that has at least a veneer of economic rationality underpinning it.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe introduction of Area Licensing to Singapore in 1975 is the classic case study of a pioneering application, but despite the success of the measure it is often seen as not being particularly relevant for other cities, and especially those in Western Europe and North America. It has taken over a quarter of a century for another scheme to essentially replicate it. Certainly there have been toll rings introduced in a number of Norwegian cities. High occupancy/toll lanes have emerged with the opening of Californian's FASTRACK north of San Diego where new capacity is priced on a real time basis in lanes that run parallel to free lanes. Although a number of other initiatives have also taken place, they have all generally been driven primarily by the need to find revenues for engineering works rather than as a policy to allocate traffic on extant networks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe basic concepts of the costs of congestion and congestion pricing are explained in 2 and 3. A brief summary of some pioneering work on the subject is presented in Section 4, followed by a description of the renewed interest in road pricing of the 1960s in Section 5. Section 6 moves on to look at some of the more recent advances in the theory of road pricing. Section 7 briefly links road pricing with capacity expansion, and Section 8 warns on the importance of the value of time. Some of the problems with implementation are described in Section 9, and Section 10 gives some brief thoughts on the applications to date. Section 11 concludes.},

abstract = {This paper shows that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) relating average flow and average density must exist on any street with blocks of diverse widths and lengths, but no turns, even if all or some of the intersections are controlled by arbitrarily timed traffic signals. The timing patterns are assumed to be fixed in time. Exact analytical expressions in terms of a shortest path recipe are given, both, for the street's capacity and its MFD. Approximate formulas that require little data are also given. For networks, the paper derives an upper bound for average flow conditional on average density, and then suggests conditions under which the bound should be tight; i.e., under which the bound is an approximate MFD. The MFD's produced with this method for the central business districts of San Francisco (California) and Yokohama (Japan) are compared with those obtained experimentally in earlier publications. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Under nonlinear road pricing (or tolling), the price charged is not strictly proportional to the distance travelled inside a tolling area, the generalized travel cost is not link-wise additive, and finding a user equilibrium distribution is typically formulated as a complementarity problem. The latter is a difficult problem to solve in mathematical programming. In this paper, we use piecewise linear functions to determine tolls and show that finding a user equilibrium distribution with such functions can be formulated as a convex optimization problem that is based on path flows and solvable by traditional algorithms such as simplicial decomposition. For area-based and two-part pricing schemes, the tolling function consists of only one linear piece and finding a user equilibrium distribution reduces to a convex optimization problem formulated in terms of link flows and solvable by any software for linearly constrained convex programs.To find an optimal pricing scheme, e.g., one that maximizes the social benefit, we formulate the problem as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, an optimization problem that is generally non-convex and difficult to solve. However, it is possible to use search algorithms to find an optimal scheme because the number of parameters in our piecewise linear function is few. To illustrate, we use a coordinate search algorithm to find an optimal two-part pricing scheme for a small network with randomly generated data. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Li2002,
abstract = {The paper aims to address the practical relevance of each of three empirical elements, namely, the speed-flow relationship, the demand function and the generalized cost that affect the implementation of a congestion pricing system. We first derive the theoretical congestion toll estimate for a class of speed-flow relationship known as the generalized Drake model. We then propose an iterative procedure to pinpoint the optimal congestion toll based on a speed-flow relationship and a value of the generalized cost in the absence of a demand function. Several practical implications will be highlighted concerning, in particular, the treatment of peak and off-peak congestion pricing. For the role of the generalized cost, we show that, in the absence of a demand function, an inaccurate value of the generalized cost will almost always lead to non-optimal, but convergent outcome. A practical implication of this "false convergence" is that a rough estimate of the generalized cost will be sufficient to obtain a congestion toll that is quite close to the optimal toll value by realizing that a speed-flow relationship is just an average relationship that is subject to certain degree of variations. We conclude the paper by applying these results to Singapore's road pricing system. Generic distance-based toll estimation tables are given for the purpose of checking the optimality of actual congestion tolls on the expressways and the restricted zone (RZ) when the information on the observed traffic situation and the value of the generalized cost become available. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This paper considers the second-best problem where not all links of a congested transportation network can be tolled. This paper builds on earlier work, in which the second-best tax rule for this problem was derived for general static networks, so that the solution presented is valid for any graph of the network, and for any set of tolling points available on that network. An algorithm is presented for finding second-best tolls, based on this general solution. A simulation model is used for studying its performance for various archetype pricing schemes: a toll-cordon, area licences, parking policies in the city centre, pricing of a single major highway, and pay-lanes and 'free-lanes' on major highways. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis is given of a method for selecting the optimal location of toll points when not all links can be tolled. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{DeBorger2001,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyse optimal two-part tariffs in the presence of extemalities within the framework of a model of discrete choice. The prototype application of the model is optimal taxation of car ownership and car use to correct for external costs. The externality we consider is allowed to cause feedback effects on demand and ownership shares and, therefore, on tax revenues. It is found that only the feedback effect of the externality on ownership shares is important in determining the optimal tax structure. When external costs differ between car types, it is shown that the role of fixed taxes crucially depends on the available variable tax instruments; various restrictions on variable tax instruments are analysed. We also study the implications of heterogeneity and distributive concerns for the optimal taxation of externalities via user and ownership taxes. We identify the specific role of the distribution of ownership and of conditional demands as well as the distributive impact of the externality itself. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Saberi2012,
abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate the properties of network-level traffic flow relationships in a freeway network with the use of commonly available loop detector data. The impact of the spatial and temporal distribution of congestion in a selected network on the shape and properties of the flow-density relation is investigated, with emphasis on the formation and characterization of hysteresis patterns. Accordingly, a path-dependent characterization of hysteresis patterns in freeway networks is introduced and illustrated conceptually as well as through empirical observations. Comparison of the spatial and temporal distribution of congestion throughout a selected subnetwork on different days suggests a relationship between the size of the hysteresis loop and the inhomogeneity of the traffic distribution. The maximum network average flow is not a constant value but varies across different days. In addition, for the same value of average network occupancy, the variation of occupancy is higher during the recovery period compared with the loading period. The observed large variation in network occupancy during recovery implies the formation of fragmented queues and traffic instability. A chaotic pattern is also to be expected in the networkwide flow-occupancy plane when the spatial distribution of link densities is inhomogeneous and the average network occupancy remains consistently high and roughly unchanged for successive time intervals. Overall, the study results provide a deeper understanding of the properties of networkwide relations on freeway networks.},

@article{Mariotte2017,
abstract = {Large-scale network modeling using the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) is widely based on the single-reservoir model, where the variation of the accumulation of circulating vehicles in the reservoir equals inflow minus outflow. However, inconsistent lags for information propagation between boundaries may be observed with this single accumulation-based model. For example, outflow is reacting too fast when inflow varies rapidly, whereas this information should be carried by vehicles that are never driving faster than the free-flow speed. To overcome this limitation, a trip-based model has been recently proposed, but whose solution cannot be obtained analytically. In this paper we compare both models under piecewise linear MFD and a piecewise constant demand. These assumptions allow to establish the exact solution of the accumulation-based model, and continuous approximations of the trip-based model at any order using Taylor series. Moreover, a flexible event-based simulation framework is implemented to solve the latter model, making it a promising tool to account for heterogeneity in distance traveled. Thanks to these resolution schemes we are able to measure the inaccuracy of the accumulation-based approach when the demand varies rapidly, and propose a validity domain for this model. Other applications with different trip lengths and supply limitations are also discussed.},

@article{Herman1984,
abstract = {A series of vehicular traffic experiments conducted in Austin, Texas, shows the reasonableness of the two assumptions in the two-fluid (moving and stopped vehicles) model of town traffic. The observational data support the assumption that the average speed in an urban street network is proportional to the fraction of the vehicles moving raised to a power and is also in agreement with the supposition that during relatively uniform periods the traffic is ergodic. An important consequence is that the average of the fraction of time stopped for a test vehicle circulating in a street network is approximately equal to the average fraction of the vehicles stopped in the system during the same test period. The parameters of the two-fluid model and the observed ranges of trip time and stop time per unit distance have been shown to be effective in assessing or rank ordering the relative quality of traffic service in a number of Texas cities; comparisons are made with various cities around the world. The two-fluid methodology appears to be useful in a preliminary "before"/after" study during which signal timing changes were made. Finally, a preliminary analysis of aerial photographic data in two cities allows the determination of an additional two-fluid model parameter, p, in the relation stating that the fraction of vehicles stopped is given by the ratio of concentration to the jam or maximum concentration raised to a power, p. It is suggested that this parameter may be useful in describing the relative quality of various traffic systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
